                    Each time I’d walk in, I would throw my voice and wait for it to return.
                    
                    This occasion I couldn’t turn away. In here, the answers for my questions had been imbued within its existence: Why was I fired from the firm? Where did that singing come from? What had tied my life inextricably to the production of Milk? As far I knew, these matters had been completely unrelated until I was brought to the attention of this room.
                    
                    I gradually came to recognise that in here, these subjects had no unique qualities. I couldn’t ask these questions individually rather they shared the same answer. I had a sudden sinking feeling – one that became physical, like I had started the long descent to bottom of the ocean. I continued down the hallway although there was no end in sight. At some point I stopped and questioned, does such a room exist? It must end, it has to end. My feet were steady against the tiled floor, I pressed on into complete darkness.
                    
                    What must have been thirty minutes since I had entered – I must’ve either fell unconscious or experienced what I could only imagine is dying. Both legs seized and I was unable to walk. I started experiencing visions – or colours, at first there were many and in quick succession. I began retching as I induced what a seizure might feel like. The retching caused my stomach to twist, and I quickly fell to the wall of the room. There was no doubt what I was experiencing was real, maybe the first real feeling I had had for a long time. The colours began to ease into one another and as I concentrated on them a sequence began playing out. Whilst I couldn’t recall the sequence as colours, I remember exactly what it sounded like.
